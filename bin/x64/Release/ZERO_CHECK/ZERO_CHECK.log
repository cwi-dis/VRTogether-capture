  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/dev2/pilot2/cwipc_realsense2/bin/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.

    is newer than 'C:/dev2/pilot2/cwipc_realsense2/bin/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'

  CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:49 (find_package):
    Policy CMP0074 is not set: find_package uses <PackageName>_ROOT variables.
    Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0074" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
    command to set the policy and suppress this warning.
  
    Environment variable PCL_ROOT is set to:
  
      C:\Program Files\PCL 1.8.1
  
    For compatibility, CMake is ignoring the variable.
  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
